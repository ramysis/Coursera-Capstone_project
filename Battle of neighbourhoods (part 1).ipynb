This is because they not only want to study at a great establishment but also want to explore the new city that they are going to be living in for the next few years. So you could say that they are tourists who are also studying. We will be focusing on students that want to study in an English speaking country as they want to develop their knowledge of the language but are having difficulties deciding which country they want to explore.\n\nLondon and Toronto are quite the popular tourist destinations for people all around the world. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is widely sought after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of London and Toronto respectively and draw insights to what they look like now."

As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighbourhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighbourhood. For each neighbourhood, we have chosen the radius to be 500 meters.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighbourhood : Name of the Neighbourhood\n2. Neighbourhood Latitude : Latitude of the Neighbourhood\n3. Neighbourhood Longitude : Longitude of the Neighbourhood\n4. Venue : Name of the Venue\n5. Venue Latitude : Latitude of Venue\n6. Venue Longitude : Longitude of Venue\n7. Venue Category : Category of Venue\n\nBased on all the information collected for both London and Toronto, we have sufficient data to build our model. We cluster the neighbourhoods together based on similar venue categories. We then present our observations and findings. Using this data, the international students can take the necessary decision."
